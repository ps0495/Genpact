So, it displays our performance.</p><p>The QVA program is an independent review on a pursuit to identify the risks and opportunities in the pursuit.</p><p>The review process is collaborative, where the Reviewer provides recommendations to the team on how to address and optimize the delivery.</p><p>It captures client expectations for the pursuit, during the sales and delivery processes, and determines if there is any misalignment with the client on expectations, or accountability with respect to the commercial arrangement.</p><p>The QVA program helps build strong Pursuit and Delivery Leaders, through QVA certification program.</p><p>Participation in these reviews helps you grow as an individual leader and as a pursuit leader. It will increase your knowledge on how to drive complex pursuit, which may encompass Digital and Analytics and Consulting.</p><p>Last but not the least, the QVA program fosters a learning environment, across projects and portfolio leaders. You can leverage those learnings in the next pursuit or delivery. Further, the QVA program also prevents recurrence of possible deal misalignment and delivery issues.</p></font></div></body></html>
