That means, even if the recommendation is &ldquo;Not to Proceed&rdquo;, the system will not allow the Seller, the LCP, or the Pursuit Lead to submit the opportunity to On-Bid. This is to ensure that the senior leadership has an opportunity to discuss whether the opportunity should proceed in its current form or it should be re-worked from a solution, staffing, or pricing standpoint. If the leadership decides to proceed with the opportunity in its current form, then the Vertical Lead will need to approve it on SFDC for the deal to move to On-Bid. Alternatively, the Vertical Lead can recommend that the solution be re-worked and re-submitted for the QVA review.</p></font></div></body></html>
