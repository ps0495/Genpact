You learnt that:</p><ul><li>Pursuit QVA review ensures that you consistently offer your clients a differentiated value proposition, aligned with their expected outcomes.</li><li>The Vertical Leads designates an opportunity for a QVA review, before the opportunity is approved to move to Define.</li><li>The opportunities designated for a QVA review cannot move to Define, unless the QVA Reviewer completes and documents the review.</li><li>Despite any recommendations from the QVA Reviewer, the Vertical Lead and LCP take the final decision on whether to proceed with the opportunity or not. The system does not prevent the opportunity from going to the next phase, provided the leadership reviews it.</li></ul><p>The QVA review documentation is stored at a common SharePoint site, and will be accessible to both the Pursuit team as well as the Delivery team, so that there is a continuity of information.</p></font></div></body></html>
