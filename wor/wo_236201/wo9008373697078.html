The Pursuit Lead schedules the review after confirming with Annie.</p><p>Let us see how Annie conducts the QVA review.</p><p>Annie starts the review with discussing the client needs and our value proposition and understanding the solution, approach, and deliverables.</p><p>She verifies whether the team is clear on the value and differentiator to win?</p><p>The team was not clear on the value and Annie discusses to make our value proposition compelling.</p><p>Annie next asks: what is our solution approach?</p><p>Annie confirms whether the approach is above or beyond the scope of what the client has asked.</p><p>In this case, it is a strategy project.</p><p>So, Annie looks at how the project is starting and if the team has all the input deliverables from the client.</p><p>Further, she asks: are the deliverables clearly defined and ownership understood by the team?</p><p>Once the approach is determined, Annie looks at the Staffing model.</p><p>Does the team have the right people, with the right skills, in the right location, at the right time, to deliver the project? What is the risk?</p><p>After validating with the team, Annie recognizes that 3 data analysts and 2 consulting people should be added.</p><p>When all those things are aligned, Annie moves to the pricing model.</p><p>Is the commercial arrangement appropriate for the nature of work?</p><p>Are we priced to win?</p><p>Annie states that every deal should have contingency.</p><p>Have we adequately assessed the delivery risk and priced in contingency accordingly?</p><p>Annie then refers the amber or red QSRM scoring and discusses risk mitigants.</p></font></div></body></html>
